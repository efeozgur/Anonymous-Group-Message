##### ABOUT THE PROJECT #####
Nowadays, many people communicate with each other via online messages on many platforms in line with the opportunities provided by the Internet. Through this widespread communication, many mobile and web applications are needed. AGM is one of the applications that will meet these needs. It lets its users communicate via online messages through groups that users establish. In this way, users can send messages, share advertisements, announcements through groups established by users. One of the most important features of AGM is to provide communication by keeping all private information such as telephone numbers and e-mail addresses confidential, based on the fact that users only know each other's user names. The application is implemented with ASP .Net MVC web technology in order to increase the communication quality of the users and enable them to communicate with each other through the privacy framework.
